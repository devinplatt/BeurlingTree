BeurlingTree
============

Code for generating a tree for the partial order of factorizations of Beurling generalized integers.
For more information on the topic, see my blog posts:

The implementation is in C++. In the future I might write versions in other languages, but for now
this is all you get.

I've decided to implement my own basic tree data structure rather than using a library like
Boost::Graph for simplicity and for the sake of not having to learn the API. For that reason I had
to provide my own method of serialization, which may not be the most efficient.

This is a work in progress. The basic code for building the tree is now all available, for both the
cases of prime powers and for all factorizations. Code for building a single path down the tree
is desired, but an implementation is not available yet. More on the way soon!

Documentation is provided in the separate Documentation.txt file.
