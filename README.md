BeurlingTree
============

Code for generating a tree for the partial order of factorizations of Beurling generalized integers.

I've decided to implement my own basic tree data structure rather than using a library like
Boost::Graph simply for the sake of not having to learn the API. For that reason I had to provide
my own method of serialization, which may not be the most efficient.

At the moment I've uploaded the Tree and Factorization classes. More on the way soon!
